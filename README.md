## Overview

This project develops a reproducible deep-learning pipeline for classifying a pediatric chest X-ray as **normal** or **pneumonia**. It compares a custom convolutional neural network with an ImageNet-pretrained DenseNet121 under the same leakage-aware evaluation protocol.

> **Scope:** The dataset contains chest radiographs from children aged approximately 1-5 years. Results must not be generalized to adults or other clinical settings without external validation.

## Dataset caveats and split policy

The Kaggle archive contains `train`, `val`, and `test` folders, but the provided validation directory contains only 16 images. It is therefore not used as the project's model-selection validation set.

Before training, the data owner must audit patient identifiers, exact hashes, and potential near-duplicates across all provided folders.

Preferred protocol:

1. Combine the provided `train` and `val` folders for development.
2. Create a new patient/group-level internal validation split using seed 42.
3. Keep the provided `test` folder locked only if the audit confirms no patient or duplicate overlap with development data.
4. If overlap is found, pool all images and rebuild train/validation/test at patient or duplicate-group level using the ratios in `configs/data.yaml`.
5. Select the model, early-stopping point, and decision threshold using validation data only.

Reported image-level metrics:

- Macro F1
- Pneumonia sensitivity
- Specificity
- ROC-AUC
- PR-AUC
- Confusion matrix

## Getting started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Medical-Xray-AI/pneumonia-xray.git
cd pneumonia-xray
```

### 2. Install the project dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Authenticate and download the dataset locally

Every team member must download the pinned Kaggle Version 2 on their own computer. The dataset is public, so start without authentication:

```bash
python scripts/download_data.py
```

If Kaggle explicitly returns an authorization error, retry once with `python scripts/download_data.py --login`. The login validation is deferred to the actual download request. Later runs reuse an already valid local copy without downloading or overwriting it.

The command downloads into the Git-ignored `data/raw/kaggle/` directory, validates all expected class counts, finds the actual `chest_xray` root, and writes that path to the local `.env`. It never writes Kaggle credentials to the repository.

If the dataset was already downloaded elsewhere:

```bash
python scripts/download_data.py --data-root "/absolute/path/to/chest_xray"
```

### 4. Verify the local copy

Before the split is frozen, this verifies the 5,856-image inventory:

```bash
python scripts/verify_local_data.py
```

After Member 1 commits the reviewed manifests, every member must run the full local verification:

```bash
python scripts/verify_local_data.py --require-manifests
```

### 5. Optional manual path configuration

The download command updates `.env` automatically. To configure it manually, copy the template:

```bash
# Windows CMD
copy .env.example .env

# Linux/macOS
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and point it to the extracted `chest_xray` directory and a machine-local output directory:

```env
XRAY_DATA_ROOT=/path/to/chest_xray
XRAY_OUTPUT_ROOT=outputs
XRAY_NUM_WORKERS=4
```

The real `.env` file must remain local and must never be committed.

### 6. Check the GPU environment

Before installing or upgrading PyTorch on the shared GPU server, follow [`docs/GPU_GUIDE.md`](docs/GPU_GUIDE.md). Dependency versions remain provisional until the server's Python, CUDA, PyTorch, and torchvision versions have been audited.

### 7. Verify the repository entry point

```bash
python run_all.py --check
```

The complete training and inference commands will be connected to `run_all.py` as reviewed modules are integrated.

## Dataset

The approved dataset is pinned as `paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/versions/2`. Download it with `python scripts/download_data.py`; do not manually copy it into Git. The local `XRAY_DATA_ROOT` will point to:

```text
chest_xray/
|-- train/
|   |-- NORMAL/
|   `-- PNEUMONIA/
|-- val/
|   |-- NORMAL/
|   `-- PNEUMONIA/
`-- test/
    |-- NORMAL/
    `-- PNEUMONIA/
```

See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for the data policy and [`data/manifests/README.md`](data/manifests/README.md) for the manifest contract.

Member 1 (or the leader performing the data-owner integration) creates the audit evidence and the single team split with:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_data.py
```

Only the reviewed relative-path manifests and safe aggregate audit evidence are committed. Other members download locally and verify against those same frozen manifests; they do not generate personal splits.

## Reproducibility

Every meaningful experiment must record:

- Git commit SHA
- Config file and random seed
- Split version
- Device and peak GPU memory
- Training duration and best epoch
- Validation metrics
- External checkpoint location

Runs are tracked in [`docs/experiment_registry.csv`](docs/experiment_registry.csv). Large outputs and checkpoints remain outside Git.

## Team workflow

Development is branch- and pull-request-based. Direct development on `main` is avoided after the initial bootstrap, and each pull request requires at least one teammate review.
